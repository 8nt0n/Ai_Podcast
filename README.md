1. Upload your pdfs to chat gpt with the prompt from the .txt file, and then let him answer (3 answers needed by default since open ai has a  max output limit), then save everything into something like "Script.txt".
2. Download any gameplay footage and put it into videos/{your_video}.mp4 (by default the script will choose videos/mc.mp4 for minecraft parkour footage)
3. run the script. the rest should happen automatically
